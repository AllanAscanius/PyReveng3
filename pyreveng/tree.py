This class implements a basic recursive split-in-the-middle-interval-tree

An interval-tree is a tree of intervals (duh!) which is useful here
for keeping track of the bits we have taken apart.

The objects you put into the tree must come with numerical .lo and
.hi attributes, but you get to define the class(es) for that in
your own code.

Instantiating the tree you must provide the valid [lo...hi] interval.

There is also an optional parameter to limit how narrow ranges we
create subtrees for.  If it ever needs changing, we should probably
change the algorithm to split trees based on actual number of nodes,
rather than the interval they cover, but for now it seems to work
pretty ok.
