PyReveng3 is a toolkit for reverse engineering and analysing binary
programs, or for that matter any binary data, for computer archaeologic
investigations.

Computers used to be pretty strange, and some of the fundamental
assumptions modern reverse-engineering tools make, notably "memory
is a linear array of bytes", makes them useless for historic computers.

PyReveng3 approaches all such issues with as much generality as possible,
to handle any weird computer architecture I have ever encountered.

Another important idea has been to make it easy to add a new
disassembler, without having to deal with a lot of binary arithmetic,
by taking in the instruction descriptions as they are typically
found in manuals::

    PUSH    r2      |0 1 0 1 0| reg |
    PUSH    sr      |0 0 0|sr |1 1 0|
    POP     W,ea    |1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1|mod|0 0 0| rm  |
    POP     r2      |0 1 0 1 1| reg |
    POP     sr      |0 0 0|sr |1 1 1|
    XCHG    r,ea    |1 0 0 0 0 1 1|w|mod| reg | rm  |
    XCHG    W,a,r2  |1 0 0 1 0| reg |
    NOP     -       |1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0|

Disassemblers are not just for CPUs, they can also be used to
analyze interpreted code instructions, graphical primitives
and much more.

The fundamental strategy is to build data structures representing the
analysis, available for further programatic spelunking, rather than
just a textual representation where the structure is flattened.

Of course, dumping the textual representation in the shape of a
listing is one of the most typical "further programatic spelunkings"
one can do, but it is not limited to only that.

The project contains a number of examples which I have deemed both
sufficiently obsolete, obscure and out-dated to be covered by the
"fair use" doctrine, if you disagree please let me know.

Should you have access to the original source code for any of the
examples, I would love to receive a copy, even if I cannot publish
it.
