PyReveng3 is a toolkit for reverse engineering and analysing binary
programs, or for that matter, binary data.

The fundamental idea is to build data structures representing the
analysis, available for further programatic spelunking, rather than
just a textual representation where the structure is flattened.

Of course, dumping the textual representation in the shape of a
listing is one of the most typical "further programatic spelunkings"
one can do, but it is not limited to only that.

Enjoy,
